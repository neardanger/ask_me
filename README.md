Ask-Me
Description: A quora/ask.fm hybrid where users can ask questions and receive answers to them;
the website has administrators that can edit posts

Technologies Used: Bootstrap, Ruby on rails, CSS, HTML, PostgreSQL, Heroku

Approach: Ever since I was 12 years old I've always dreamed of being an administrator on
a website; now that I have my own website I can do just that, I can delete comments and edit them.
When I first created the models to my site it wasn't always about posting questions, my initial approach
was to create a website where users could post confessions and then other users could comment. However
I wanted to make it anonymous so that anyone could come and post whatever they want; however I have an
administrator too, so they can delete or edit mean comments.

Unsolved Problems:

I should have added another model in the modeling process. A model called admin.
